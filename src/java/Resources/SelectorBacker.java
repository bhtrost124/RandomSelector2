 * This Application was designed for a user to keep track of shows that they are
 * watching, how far behind in that show they are, and in the event of not being
 * able to decide what to watch randomly selects one for them.
 *
 * This backing bean is application scoped for the reason that I was the only
 * intended user, thus the series list can be considered as always being present
 * for the application. It was originally developed as request scoped, and it
 * worked just fine like that, but I wanted to eliminate the constant database
 * queries as well as test out other scopes.
